# Reconstruction Algorithm
## File Description

* nodeLinks.py generates the weight matrix for every link in the wireless network. Weights saved to defineWeights.json to avoid redundant computation. 
* reconstructor.py has the reconstruction algorithms.
* imaging.py produces the images from the RSSI values and Weights.
* defineNodes.json contains defined absolute positions of WiFi modules in CENTIMETERS. Current configuration: 20 Nodes 40cm apart in Square arrangement.
