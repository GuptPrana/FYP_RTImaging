# IOT-Based Radio Tomographic Imaging

## Project Introduction

In Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI), wireless signal transceivers are arranged as individual wireless nodes that are part of a wireless network. Links are formed between every possible pair of nodes in the network, in which one node momentarily receives a signal from the other node. The signal attenuation due to physical obstruction in every link in the network is measured to generate an image of the object.

There is considerable research on this imaging modality to demonstrate its potential in various scenarios such as in general through-the-wall surveillance, rescue operations, and in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. However, one major drawback of using RTI systems is that the real-time images generated are often not of high resolution. This is mainly due to the different contributing factors of signal attenuation, including the distance between nodes, constructive and destructive interference between signals, and environmental factors. Therefore, this project aims to explore different methods to improve the imaging quality, and ultimately, build an IoT-based RTI system that truly meets the industrial standards for its applications.
